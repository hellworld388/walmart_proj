Database Setup:
The user runs the SQL scripts in db_setup (schema.sql and data.sql) to set up the database before starting the backend.
Environment Variables:

change password and create a .env file in your backend with the following infor: 
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=supplydb
DB_PASS=sarvesh12
DB_PORT=5432
PORT=4000


another thing is to run the setup.bat create supplydb database and then update password wherever necessary. 
Dependencies:
The user runs npm install in both customer_backend and customer_frontend to install dependencies.
Start Order:
Start the backend (npm start or node server.js in customer_backend).
Start the frontend (npm start in customer_frontend).
CORS/Ports:
The frontend and backend should be configured to communicate (e.g., backend runs on port 4000, frontend on 3000).
